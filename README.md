# neural-network-charity-analysis

## Overview
In this project neural networks will be used to help predicting where to invest as a foundation. With the help of Machine Learning and Neural Networks we will create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by the foundation (Alphabet Soup).

The data will be taken from a .csv file containing more than 34k organizations that have received funding in the past.

The process of completing this project is as follows:
- Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
- Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
- Optimizing the Model

## Results
- Data Preprocessing
  - Variables considered as targets
  - Variables considered as features
  - Variables that should be removed

- Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
  - Number of Neurons, Layers and Activation Functions selected for the model
  - Target Model Performance
  - Steps taken to increase model performance
 
## Summary
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
